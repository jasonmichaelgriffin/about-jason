		<p>Jason is a huge coffee enthusiast with 17 coffee makers, five grinders, and even roasts his own beans at home. <br/>
		He doesn't commonly refer to himself in the third person but it seems appropriate here<br/>
		Another passion is sporting clays/general marksmanship. <br/>
		He has lived in Amsterdam, Oakland, Fremont (silicon valley), a half year in England, and four months in Prague. <br/>
		Costa Rica is his favorite place to unwind and relax.  Travel is a passion but true travel is often stressful, <br/>
		so having a place that is truly a vacation spot is a luxury he is lucky enough to have. <br/>
		Though tall for an American he is only slightly above average for a Dutch man at 6' 5". <br>
		Despite initial appearances to the contrary he is a tattoo enthusiast and working on a 2/3rds body suit. <br/>
		At 39 he feels he has started to earn his grey hair but he actually went grey at 16 years old.<br/>
		He hopes to spend the rest of his life in New Mexico, there is nowhere else he would rather live.</p>
